    "This notebook overviews the process of defining CRRT: a treatment used to dialyse or filter a patient's blood continuously. Key to CRRT is its lower speed compared to conventional dialysis: avoidance of rapid solute/fluid loss is suspected to be the main reason why CRRT tends to be tolerated better than intermittent hemodialysis.\n",

    "The primary aim of this notebook is to define the start and end times of CRRT for patients in the MIMIC-III database v1.4.\n",

    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps in defining a clinical concept in MIMIC-III are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identification of key terms and phrases which describe the concept\n",
    "2. Search for these terms in D_ITEMS (or D_LABITEMS if searching for a laboratory measurement)\n",
    "3. Extraction of the data from tables specified in the `LINKSTO` column of D_ITEMS\n",
    "4. Definition of the concept using rules applied to the data extracted\n",
    "5. Validation of the concepts by individual inspection and aggregate statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is iterative and not as clear cut as the above - validation may lead you to redefine data extraction, and so on. Furthermore, in the case of MIMIC-III v1.4, this process must be repeated twice: once for Metavision, once for CareVue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MetaVision vs. CareVue\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue in MIMIC-III is that it is a combination of two ICU database systems. As a result, concepts are split among different `ITEMID` values. For example, a patient's heart rate is a relatively simple concept to extract, however, if we look in the D_ITEMS table for labels matching 'heart rate', we find at least two `ITEMID`:\n",
    "\n",
    "itemid |          label          |  abbreviation   |  dbsource  |   linksto\n",
    "--------|-------------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------\n",
    "211 | Heart Rate              |                 | carevue    | chartevents\n",
    "220045 | Heart Rate              | HR              | metavision | chartevents\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these `ITEMID` values capture heart rate - but one is used for the CareVue database system (`dbsource = 'carevue'`) and one is used for the MetaVision database system (`dbsource = 'metavision'`). The data extraction step must be repeated twice: once for `dbsource = 'carevue'` and once for `dbsource = 'metavision'`. In general, it is recommended to extract data from MetaVision first, as the data is better structured and provides useful information for what data elements to include. For example, `ITEMID` values in MetaVision have abbrevations with each label - these abbreviations can then be used to search for data elements in CareVue."

Intuitively this can be done by looking for consecutive settings each hour, and combining these into a single CRRT event. The first observed `CHARTTIME` becomes the `STARTTIME`, and the last observed `CHARTTIME` becomes the `ENDTIME`. However, CHARTEVENTS is not the only source of data. To improve the accuracy of our calculation, we also include data from INPUTEVENTS_MV and PROCEDUREEVENTS_MV. For INPUTEVENTS_MV, this does not complicate things too much. Each observation in INPUTEVENTS_MV is also stored at a single `CHARTTIME`, and so we simply need to combine this table with CHARTEVENTS before proceeding (likely by using the SQL `UNION` command).\n",
