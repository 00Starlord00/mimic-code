# Vagrant VM for MIMIC II

See: [mimic-ii-vm](https://github.com/nsh87/mimic-ii-vm)

Vagrant allows you to easily automate the creation of virtual machines.
The [mimic-ii-vm](https://github.com/nsh87/mimic-ii-vm) repository will
create a virtual machine with Vagrant, download the MIMIC II data, and
make it accessible to you via command line or graphical interface with
a single command.

The automated steps performed on the VM are similar to those in the
[Install MIMIC locally](http://mimic.physionet.org/tutorials/install_mimic_locally/)
instructions on the official website.
